Website source on Github.

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to author my posts. Some cool scripting and neat programming after long time.

See [here](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/install-jekyll-on-os-x/) how to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on Mac. 

Feel free to fork!
